# Project Overview:
The Expense Tracker application is a web-based platform designed to assist users in managing and tracking their expenses efficiently. The application focuses on providing a user-friendly interface for creating and managing financial events, tracking expenses related to those events, and maintaining a record of past financial activities. By leveraging modern web technologies, the project aims to streamline the process of budgeting and spending.
The primary objective of the Expense Tracker application is to provide users with a comprehensive financial management tool. Users can efficiently track and manage their expenses by creating and organizing events with specified budgets. The application ensures secure user authentication, employs React.js for a dynamic and responsive user interface, utilizes Node.js and Express.js for the backend server, and stores data securely in a MongoDB database. The project aims to streamline budgeting processes, empower users in making informed financial decisions, and maintain a systematic record of their financial history.

# Technologies Used:
In this mini project, I have utilised the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack to develop both, the frontend and backend parts of the project.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
